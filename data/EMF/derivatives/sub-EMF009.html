<p>For each of the 4 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and
sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference
volume was generated, using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>,
for use in head motion correction. Head-motion parameters with respect
to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding
rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any
spatiotemporal filtering using <code>mcflirt</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">(FSL <ver>, Jenkinson et al.
2002)</span>. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w
reference using <code>mri_coreg</code> (FreeSurfer) followed by
<code>flirt</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="flirt">(FSL <ver>,
Jenkinson and Smith 2001)</span> with the boundary-based registration
<span class="citation" data-cites="bbr">(Greve and Fischl 2009)</span>
cost-function. Co-registration was configured with six degrees of
freedom. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
<em>preprocessed BOLD</em>: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three
region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations
following Power (absolute sum of relative motions, <span
class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">Power et al. (2014)</span>)
and Jenkinson (relative root mean square displacement between affines,
<span class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">Jenkinson et al.
(2002)</span>). FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run,
both using their implementations in <em>Nipype</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">(following the definitions
by Power et al. 2014)</span>. The three global signals are extracted
within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set
of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based
noise correction <span class="citation"
data-cites="compcor">(<em>CompCor</em>, Behzadi et al. 2007)</span>.
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the
<em>preprocessed BOLD</em> time-series (using a discrete cosine filter
with 128s cut-off) for the two <em>CompCor</em> variants: temporal
(tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then
calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For
aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM) are
generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of
Behzadi et al. in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD
space, a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM is
subtracted from the aCompCor masks. This mask is obtained by
thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it
ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal
fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and
binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation).
Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.
For each CompCor decomposition, the <em>k</em> components with the
largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’
time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the
nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components
are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in
the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds
file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and
global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives
and quadratic terms for each <span class="citation"
data-cites="confounds_satterthwaite_2013">(Satterthwaite et al.
2013)</span>. Frames that exceeded a threshold of 1.0 mm FD or 1.5

nuisance timeseries are calculated by means of principal components
analysis of the signal found within a thin band (<em>crown</em>) of
voxels around the edge of the brain, as proposed by <span
class="citation" data-cites="patriat_improved_2017">(Patriat, Reynolds,

single interpolation step</em> by composing all the pertinent
transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility
distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical
and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed
using <code>nitransforms</code>, configured with cubic B-spline
interpolation.</p>

<p>For each of the 6 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and
sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference
volume was generated, using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>,
for use in head motion correction. Head-motion parameters with respect
to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding
rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any
spatiotemporal filtering using <code>mcflirt</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">(FSL <ver>, Jenkinson et al.

<span class="citation" data-cites="bbr">(Greve and Fischl 2009)</span>
cost-function. Co-registration was configured with six degrees of
freedom. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
<em>preprocessed BOLD</em>: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three
region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations
following Power (absolute sum of relative motions, <span
class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">Power et al. (2014)</span>)
and Jenkinson (relative root mean square displacement between affines,
<span class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">Jenkinson et al.
(2002)</span>). FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run,
both using their implementations in <em>Nipype</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">(following the definitions
by Power et al. 2014)</span>. The three global signals are extracted
within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set
of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based
noise correction <span class="citation"
data-cites="compcor">(<em>CompCor</em>, Behzadi et al. 2007)</span>.
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the
<em>preprocessed BOLD</em> time-series (using a discrete cosine filter
with 128s cut-off) for the two <em>CompCor</em> variants: temporal
(tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then
calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For
aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM) are
generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of
Behzadi et al. in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD
space, a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM is
subtracted from the aCompCor masks. This mask is obtained by
thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it
ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal
fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and
binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation).
Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.
For each CompCor decomposition, the <em>k</em> components with the
largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’
time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the
nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components
are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in
the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds
file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and
global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives
and quadratic terms for each <span class="citation"

Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing
performed using *fMRIPrep* 23.2.1
(@fmriprep1; @fmriprep2; RRID:SCR_016216),
which is based on *Nipype* 1.8.6
(@nipype1; @nipype2; RRID:SCR_002502).


Anatomical data preprocessing

: A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input
BIDS dataset. The T1w image was corrected for intensity
non-uniformity (INU) with `N4BiasFieldCorrection` [@n4], distributed with ANTs 2.5.0
[@ants, RRID:SCR_004757], and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a *Nipype* implementation of
the `antsBrainExtraction.sh` workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs
as target template.
Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on
the brain-extracted T1w using `fast` [FSL (version unknown), RRID:SCR_002823, @fsl_fast].
Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through
nonlinear registration with `antsRegistration` (ANTs 2.5.0),
using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template.
The following template was were selected for spatial normalization
and accessed with *TemplateFlow* [23.1.0, @templateflow]:
*ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c* [@mni152nlin2009casym, RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym].

Functional data preprocessing

: For each of the 4 BOLD runs found per subject (across all
tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed.
First, a reference volume was generated,
using a custom methodology of *fMRIPrep*, for use in head motion correction.
Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference
(transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation
parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using
`mcflirt` [FSL <ver>, @mcflirt].
The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using
`mri_coreg` (FreeSurfer) followed by `flirt` [FSL <ver>, @flirt]
with the boundary-based registration [@bbr] cost-function.
Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom.
Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
*preprocessed BOLD*: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and
three region-wise global signals.
FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of
relative motions, @power_fd_dvars) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square
displacement between affines, @mcflirt).
FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their
implementations in *Nipype* [following the definitions by @power_fd_dvars].
The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and
the whole-brain masks.
Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to
allow for component-based noise correction [*CompCor*, @compcor].
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the
*preprocessed BOLD* time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with
128s cut-off) for the two *CompCor* variants: temporal (tCompCor)
and anatomical (aCompCor).
tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable
voxels within the brain mask.
For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM)
are generated in anatomical space.
The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead
of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, a mask of pixels that
likely contain a volume fraction of GM is subtracted from the aCompCor masks.
This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted
from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM.
Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by
thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation).
Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.
For each CompCor decomposition, the *k* components with the largest singular
values are retained, such that the retained components' time series are
sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF,
WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from
consideration.
The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also
placed within the corresponding confounds file.
The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global
signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and
quadratic terms for each [@confounds_satterthwaite_2013].
Frames that exceeded a threshold of 1.0 mm FD or
1.5 standardized DVARS were annotated as motion outliers.
Additional nuisance timeseries are calculated by means of principal components
analysis of the signal found within a thin band (*crown*) of voxels around
the edge of the brain, as proposed by [@patriat_improved_2017].
All resamplings can be performed with *a single interpolation
step* by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion
transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available,
and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces).
Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using `nitransforms`,
configured with cubic B-spline interpolation.


Many internal operations of *fMRIPrep* use
*Nilearn* 0.10.2 [@nilearn, RRID:SCR_001362],
mostly within the functional processing workflow.

Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
*preprocessed BOLD*: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and
three region-wise global signals.
FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of
relative motions, @power_fd_dvars) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square
displacement between affines, @mcflirt).
FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their
implementations in *Nipype* [following the definitions by @power_fd_dvars].
The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and
the whole-brain masks.
Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to
allow for component-based noise correction [*CompCor*, @compcor].
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the
*preprocessed BOLD* time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with
128s cut-off) for the two *CompCor* variants: temporal (tCompCor)
and anatomical (aCompCor).
tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable
voxels within the brain mask.
For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM)
are generated in anatomical space.
The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead
of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, a mask of pixels that
likely contain a volume fraction of GM is subtracted from the aCompCor masks.
This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted
from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM.
Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by
thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation).
Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.
For each CompCor decomposition, the *k* components with the largest singular
values are retained, such that the retained components' time series are
sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF,
WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from
consideration.
The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also
placed within the corresponding confounds file.
The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global
signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and
quadratic terms for each [@confounds_satterthwaite_2013].
Frames that exceeded a threshold of 1.0 mm FD or
1.5 standardized DVARS were annotated as motion outliers.
Additional nuisance timeseries are calculated by means of principal components
analysis of the signal found within a thin band (*crown*) of voxels around
the edge of the brain, as proposed by [@patriat_improved_2017].
All resamplings can be performed with *a single interpolation
step* by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion
transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available,
and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces).
Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using `nitransforms`,
configured with cubic B-spline interpolation.

Anatomical data preprocessing

: A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input
BIDS dataset. The T1w image was corrected for intensity
non-uniformity (INU) with `N4BiasFieldCorrection` [@n4], distributed with ANTs 2.5.0
[@ants, RRID:SCR_004757], and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a *Nipype* implementation of
the `antsBrainExtraction.sh` workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs
as target template.
Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on
the brain-extracted T1w using `fast` [FSL (version unknown), RRID:SCR_002823, @fsl_fast].
Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through
nonlinear registration with `antsRegistration` (ANTs 2.5.0),
using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template.
The following template was were selected for spatial normalization
and accessed with *TemplateFlow* [23.1.0, @templateflow]:

Functional data preprocessing

: For each of the 5 BOLD runs found per subject (across all
tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed.
First, a reference volume was generated,
using a custom methodology of *fMRIPrep*, for use in head motion correction.
Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference
(transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation
parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using
`mcflirt` [FSL <ver>, @mcflirt].
The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using
`mri_coreg` (FreeSurfer) followed by `flirt` [FSL <ver>, @flirt]
with the boundary-based registration [@bbr] cost-function.
Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom.
Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
*preprocessed BOLD*: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and
three region-wise global signals.
FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of
relative motions, @power_fd_dvars) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square
displacement between affines, @mcflirt).
FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their
implementations in *Nipype* [following the definitions by @power_fd_dvars].
The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and
the whole-brain masks.
Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to
allow for component-based noise correction [*CompCor*, @compcor].
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the
*preprocessed BOLD* time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with
128s cut-off) for the two *CompCor* variants: temporal (tCompCor)
and anatomical (aCompCor).
tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable
voxels within the brain mask.
For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM)
are generated in anatomical space.
The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead
of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, a mask of pixels that
likely contain a volume fraction of GM is subtracted from the aCompCor masks.
This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted

WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from

\item[Functional data preprocessing]
For each of the 5 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and
sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference
volume was generated, using a custom methodology of \emph{fMRIPrep}, for
use in head motion correction. Head-motion parameters with respect to
the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding
rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any
spatiotemporal filtering using \texttt{mcflirt} \citep[FSL
,][]{mcflirt}. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w
reference using \texttt{mri\_coreg} (FreeSurfer) followed by
\texttt{flirt} \citep[FSL ,][]{flirt} with the boundary-based
registration \citep{bbr} cost-function. Co-registration was configured
with six degrees of freedom. Several confounding time-series were
calculated based on the \emph{preprocessed BOLD}: framewise displacement
(FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD was computed using
two formulations following Power (absolute sum of relative motions,
\citet{power_fd_dvars}) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square
displacement between affines, \citet{mcflirt}). FD and DVARS are
calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in
\emph{Nipype} \citep[following the definitions by][]{power_fd_dvars}.
The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the
whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were
extracted to allow for component-based noise correction
\citep[\emph{CompCor},][]{compcor}. Principal components are estimated
after high-pass filtering the \emph{preprocessed BOLD} time-series
(using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two
\emph{CompCor} variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor).
tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2\% variable voxels
within the brain mask. For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM
and combined CSF+WM) are generated in anatomical space. The
implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al.~in that instead of
eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, a mask of pixels that
likely contain a volume fraction of GM is subtracted from the aCompCor
masks. This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial
volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted from
voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are
resampled into BOLD space and binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in
the original implementation). Components are also calculated separately
within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the
\emph{k} components with the largest singular values are retained, such
that the retained components' time series are sufficient to explain 50
percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or
temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The
head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed
within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series
derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with
the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each
\citep{confounds_satterthwaite_2013}. Frames that exceeded a threshold
of 1.0 mm FD or 1.5 standardized DVARS were annotated as motion
outliers. Additional nuisance timeseries are calculated by means of
principal components analysis of the signal found within a thin band
(\emph{crown}) of voxels around the edge of the brain, as proposed by
\citep{patriat_improved_2017}. All resamplings can be performed with
\emph{a single interpolation step} by composing all the pertinent
transformations (i.e.~head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility
distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical
and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed
using \texttt{nitransforms}, configured with cubic B-spline
interpolation.

Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing performed
using \emph{fMRIPrep} 23.2.1 (\citet{fmriprep1}; \citet{fmriprep2};
RRID:SCR\_016216), which is based on \emph{Nipype} 1.8.6
(\citet{nipype1}; \citet{nipype2}; RRID:SCR\_002502).

\item[Anatomical data preprocessing]
A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input BIDS
dataset. The T1w image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU)
with \texttt{N4BiasFieldCorrection} \citep{n4}, distributed with ANTs
2.5.0 \citep[RRID:SCR\_004757]{ants}, and used as T1w-reference
throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with
a \emph{Nipype} implementation of the \texttt{antsBrainExtraction.sh}
workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue
segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and
gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using
\texttt{fast} \citep[FSL (version unknown),
RRID:SCR\_002823,][]{fsl_fast}. Volume-based spatial normalization to
one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through nonlinear
registration with \texttt{antsRegistration} (ANTs 2.5.0), using
brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The
following template was were selected for spatial normalization and
accessed with \emph{TemplateFlow} \citep[23.1.0,][]{templateflow}:

    abstract = {Head motion is a significant source of noise in the estimation of functional connectivity from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Current strategies to reduce this noise include image realignment, censoring time points corrupted by motion, and including motion realignment parameters and their derivatives as additional nuisance regressors in the general linear model. However, this nuisance regression approach assumes that the motion-induced signal changes are linearly related to the estimated realignment parameters, which is not always the case. In this study we develop an improved model of motion-related signal changes, where nuisance regressors are formed by first rotating and translating a single brain volume according to the estimated motion, re-registering the data, and then performing a principal components analysis (PCA) on the resultant time series of both moved and re-registered data. We show that these “Motion Simulated (MotSim)” regressors account for significantly greater fraction of variance, result in higher temporal signal-to-noise, and lead to functional connectivity estimates that are less affected by motion compared to the most common current approach of using the realignment parameters and their derivatives as nuisance regressors. This improvement should lead to more accurate estimates of functional connectivity, particularly in populations where motion is prevalent, such as patients and young children.},
